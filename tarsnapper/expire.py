    """Given a dict of backup name => backup timestamp pairs in
    ``backups``, and a list of ``timedelta`` objects in ``deltas`` defining
    the generations, will decide which of the backups can be deleted using
    a grandfather-father-son backup strategy.

    The approach chosen tries to achieve the following:

    * Do not require backup names to include information on which generation
      a backup belongs to, like for example ``tarsnap-generations`` does.
      That is, you can create your backups anyway you wish, and simply use
      this utility to delete old backups.

    * Do not use any fixed generations (weekly, monthly etc), but freeform
      timespans.

    * Similarily, do not make any assumptions about when or if backup jobs
      have actually run or will run, but try to match the given deltas as
      closely as possible.

    What the code actually does is, for each generation, start at a fixed
    point in time determined by the most recent backup (which is always
    kept) plus the parent generation's delta and then repeatedly stepping
    the generation's delta forwards in time, chosing a backup that fits
    best which will then be kept.

    Returned is a list of backup names.
